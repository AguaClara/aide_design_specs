Piping
*******
The AguaClara plant uses PVC pipe and fittings for all plumbing, with the exception of the following
with the exception of:

#. Inlet, outlet, and drainage piping that is exposed outside the building (:numref:`figure_moroceli`). Galvanized iron pipe and fittings are used here for their durability.
#. Some connections of chemical dosing systems, which have to be flexible (:ref:`title_Dosing_Propósito_y_Descripción`). Hoses of various sizes are used.

There are no high static pressures in the plant, as the highest pressure occurs at the bottom of the filter, which is |H.Fi| deep, and does not exceed 7 psi. The thinnest drain pipe could withstand the pressure at any point in the plant, and therefore pipe specifications are not based on pressures but on overall durability and other practical considerations.

It has been observed that the small diameter, thin-walled pipes deform under the weight of the materials above them as they melt into the brick walls constructed at the plant, causing water leaks. In addition, there is a greater likelihood of breaking those that are exposed during normal operation. With larger diameter pipes the drainage specifications have walls thick enough not to deform when cast and withstand the normal abuse of operation. As a general rule, plant piping specifications are recommended based on the following guide:

    "1/2''", "SDR 13.5"
    "3/4''", "SDR 17"
    "1''-4''", "SDR 26"
    ">4''", "SDR 41"

The following table summarizes some cases where a specification different from the general guidance is sometimes recommended:

    "Any PVC piston that is used to plug a drain", "-", "SDR 41", "To facilitate the operation of the drains, it is better that the pistons are light in weight."
