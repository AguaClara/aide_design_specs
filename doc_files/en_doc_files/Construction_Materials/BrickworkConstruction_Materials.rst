Everything that is not pipe in the plant in Honduras has been built of stone, rod, brick, and concrete. The walls of the inlet tank, the flocculator, the sedimentation tanks, and the sand filters have been made of reinforced brick (). The base of the sedimentation tanks, including the sloping hoppers, has been made of stone masonry. In some cases the exterior walls of the building have been constructed of concrete blocks, although this material is not suitable for the tank walls because of its permeability.

   Common materials used in plant construction in Honduras: reinforced brick walls, stone foundations, and exterior block walls.

However, the structural design of the plant is the responsibility of the implementation partner. The Cornell University AguaClara program does not attempt to make recommendations about the structural elements of the building; the hydraulic design simply gives the internal dimensions of each vessel, the pipe diameters, the relative locations of the facilities, and the orientation of each. All the work of designing the building around the hydraulic facilities according to the technical standards of the project country and the available materials falls to the partner. It is possible that in the future the same functional plant geometries will be built with different methods and materials. Since the structural design influences the hydraulic design, the user of the design tool can specify the thickness of various walls and slabs of the plant, in order to produce a design that corresponds to the materials and construction methods that will actually be used. For example, in Honduras, brick walls of approximately 15cm thickness have been built for most tanks, but in other countries it may be necessary to build with reinforced concrete of another thickness to comply with national regulations. If the thicknesses of this design do not correspond to the structural design, another tool design can always be requested to avoid any conflict between the structural design and the hydraulic design at the time of construction. The following table summarizes the structural element thicknesses for this specific design.
