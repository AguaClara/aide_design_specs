            Personnel and supplies
----------------------

            
                    
                    
    - 
                              Operator trained in the use of AguaClara technology is always present when the plant is operating, 24 hours in most cases.

                          
                    
    - 
                              Adequate and constant dosage of a coagulating chemical (aluminium sulphate or poly aluminium chloride) for the removal of turbidity.

                          
                    
    - 
                              Adequate and constant dose of calcium hypochlorite (chlorine) for disinfection.

            Basic laboratory equipment
--------------------------

            
                    
                    
    - 
                              A portable turbidimeter, the most fundamental tool for plant operation (). This instrument is used to measure the amount of sediment brought to the plant by the influent to choose the coagulant dosage, to evaluate the performance of each process by measuring its effluent, and to record the water quality that the plant produces during the day. In the existing AguaClara plants, the HF Scientific Portable MicroTPI Turbidimeter with infrared light has been used with an effective range of 0.02 UTN to 1100 UTN.

                          
                        - 
                              The turbidimeter calibration kit to ensure accurate measurements.

                          
                    
    - 
                              Chlorine comparator to regularly check that the concentration of residual free chlorine is within the acceptable range in the distribution network.

                          
                    
    - 
                              Test tubes for measuring small volumes of liquids, especially for testing the chemical dosing system.

                          
                    
    - 
                              A scale to measure the masses of powdered chemicals for the preparation of the mother solutions of coagulant and chlorine.

                          
                    
    - 
                              A timer to measure water and chemical flows.
