AguaClara Cornell began in 2005 as a program of Cornell University’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering to design robust drinking water treatment technologies. Linked to the Honduran NGO Agua Para el Pueblo (APP) as the first implementation partner in Central America, the AguaClara Cornell program aimed to develop sustainable solutions to provide quality water in rural and peri-urban areas of that country.

Beginning with the pilot project in the urban area of the municipality of Ojojona in 2006 and 2007, AguaClara technology has evolved with each project through a process of integrating field experiences into the University’s research and design. The result is a product that is both based on the needs of the communities, the experience of the implementers, and the experiments and innovations of the Cornell laboratory. The plants are sustainable because they are built using nationally available materials and the treatment process and chemical supply systems are designed to take advantage of gravity, thus eliminating the need for electrical power. In addition, the latest versions of the technology produce water that meets the highest quality standards.

Today the program has initiatives in diverse contexts around the world including Nicaragua, Colombia, and India. In Honduras, APP continues to design and build plants, with 20 successful projects. In addition to implementing technology and training new operators and water boards, APP provides technical assistance for existing plants, distributes operating supplies, and has facilitated the formation of a water board association with AguaClara plants, called ACACH (Asociación Comunitaria de AguaClara de Honduras). APP works with the most up-to-date version of Cornell University’s designs, thus facilitating innovation at every stage of program development.
