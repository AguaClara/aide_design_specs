Treatment Processes
********************
The plants produce clean and safe water, after the removal of sediments and pathogens. AguaClara technology uses the unitary processes of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, rapid sand filtration, and chlorine disinfection (:numref:`figure_process`)

Entrance Tank
--------------------
The process starts in the **inlet tank**, which serves both to remove the coarse material from the water and to measure the water flow for the dosing of the chemicals. The inlet tank functions as a sedimentation tank in which coarse particles fall to the bottom of the tank by gravity. Due to the special design of the outlet, the water level in the tank varies in proportion to the water flow in the plant. This water level is connected to the semi-automatic chemical dosing system, so that doses of coagulant and chlorine are maintained even when the water flow in the plant changes. By means of the chemical dosing system, a coagulant is applied at the outlet of the inlet tank, which joins with the raw water in the **quick mix**.
