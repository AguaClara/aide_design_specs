Concept: generalized parametric design
--------------------------------------
*The AguaClara Infrastructure Design Tool*, known by its English abbreviation as AIDE, is developed using Onshape. The hydraulic design algorithms are written using FeatureScript. Plant geometry is drawn using the power of parametric design. The program is run to produce a three dimensional model containing all the structures, pipes, and hydraulic fittings for an AguaClara plant of that capacity. From this model, the necessary information for the construction of that facility can be extracted, such as the cuts that are adapted for the construction drawings and the configuration of all the fittings and piping.
