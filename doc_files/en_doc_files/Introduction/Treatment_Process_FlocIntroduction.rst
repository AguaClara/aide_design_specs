Treatment Processes
************************
The plants produce clean and safe water, after the removal of sediments and pathogens. AguaClara technology uses the unitary processes of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, rapid sand filtration, and chlorine disinfection (:numref:`figure_process`).

Flocculation
------------
Then the water and coagulant mixture enters the **flocculator**, a series of channels with deflectors that direct the water flow. The smooth mixture in the flocculator flow promotes collisions between particles, and these get stuck by the effect of the coagulant's nanoparticles. During this process, which is called flocculation, the particles grow, forming agglomerations (**floccules**). In the end they have reached a visible size, and have a high enough terminal velocity to be eliminated in the next process, the **sedimentation**.
