Exit Manifolds

Unlike the entry manifolds, the exit manifolds have slotted pipes instead of perforated pipes for the branches. The slots are |W.FiManSlots| wide, so that water can enter the pipe but sand cannot.

   The exit manifold with the slotted tubes.

The collective area of the slots per manifold is twice the collective area of the holes in the backwash manifold, because these exit manifolds extract the water from two sand layers each. The length of the slots is defined to achieve the desired collective area:

.. math::
    :label: groove_length

    L_{Groove}=\frac{A_{Layer}\bullet S_{Groove}}{W_{Groove}\bullet N_{Branch}\bullet L_{Branch}\bullet N_{Rows}}

| Where
| :math:`A_{Layer}` = the beloved collective area = |A.FiOutletManSlots|
| :math:`S_{Groove}` = the separation of the slots = |B.FiManSlot|
| :math:`W_{Groove}` = the width of the slots = |W.FiManSlots|
| :math:`N_{Branch}` = the number of branches per manifold = |N.FiManBranch|
| :math:`L_{Branch}` = the slotted length of the branch = |L.FiOutletBranchSlotted|
| :math:`N_{Rows}` = the number of rows of slots per string = |N.FiSlotRows| (means both sides have slots)

The pressure drop through the slots during normal filtration is given by:

.. math::
    :label: groove_head_loss

    {HL}_{Orifice}=\frac{\left(\frac{Q_{Layer}}{A_{Layer}\Pi_{VC}\varepsilon_{Sand}}\right)^2}{2g}

| Where
| :math:`Q_{Layer}` = the flow rate of water through the manifold
| :math:`A_{Layer}` = the collective area of the slots in the manifold
| :math:`\Pi _{VC}` = the coefficient of vein contracted for an orifice = |Pi.VCOrifice|
| :math:`\varepsilon_{Sand}` = the porosity of the sand bed = |Îµ.FiSand|
