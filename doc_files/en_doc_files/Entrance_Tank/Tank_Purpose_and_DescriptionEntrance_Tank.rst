Purpose and Description
*****************************

.. _heading_functions:

Functions
----------
The main functions of the entrance tank are:

#. Remove coarse solids from water by sedimentation.
#. Measure the water flow rate for chemical dosing.
#. Strain thick materials such as leaves so that they do not accumulate in the flocculator.
#. Provide a space for raw water observation.

.. _heading_location:

Location
---------
The entrance tank is located in the first part of the first channel of the flocculator (). With processes integrated in this way an efficient design is maintained with respect to the occupied area. The entrance tank and the flocculator are designed together to optimize the necessary space, minimize the cost and meet the operational requirements (:std std-ref:`Design Algorithm`).

.. _heading_water flow:

Water flow
-----------
A PVC tee is placed in each inlet tube which directs the jets towards the side walls of the tank, thus avoiding strong currents in the direction of the sedimentation plates. From the inlet, the water passes through a screen that strains thick materials such as leaves. Then the flow turns around in the lower part of the tank and rises, dividing between the |N.EtPlates| sedimentation plates.

The linear flow meter
----------------------
The entrance tank also serves to measure the water flow in the plant. The Linear Flow Orifice Meter (LFOM) is a series of holes in the tank outlet pipe that creates a linear relationship between the water level and the flow rate. The height of the water is connected to the chemical dosing system through a float so that the operator does not have to change the flow of chemicals every time the flow in the plant changes. The LFOM is described in more detail in the next section.
