Purpose and Description
************************

The flocculator causes particles suspended in the water to collide and agglomerate to form larger aggregates called flocs. The goal of the flocculation and sludge blanketing processes is to minimize the concentration of inorganic and pathogenic particles that are not in flocs. Since there are two processes that help achieve this goal we can take advantage of the benefits of each process. In flocculation the deformation of the fluid causes only particles of similar size to collide and agglomerate. Through the flocculation process, the concentration of particles that have not coalesced into flocs decreases. Therefore, the rate of collisions between primary particles also decreases and the yield rate of the flocculation process decreases.

The collision process between particles and flocs in the sludge blanket is independent of the primary particle concentration. Therefore, the optimal design includes a fast flocculation process and then the sludge blanket to efficiently continue the process of reducing the primary particle concentration. Since it is not important to make large flocs and since the AguaClara hydraulic flocculator design has an energy dissipation rate that is relatively uniform compared to mechanical flocculators it is possible to make a flocculator with a high velocity gradient. The high velocity gradient also eliminates the problem of floc sedimentation in conventional hydraulic flocculators.

The flocculation process before the sludge blanket is key for two reasons. First, flocculation is very efficient in lowering the concentration when high turbidity peaks. Second, the water treatment plant must be able to operate and start up without a sludge blanket. This is why the hydraulic flocculator is key to the good performance of the AguaClara plant even though it is a fast process.

The hydraulic flocculation process starts with potential energy with a difference in water level between upstream and downstream of the flocculator of |HL.Floc|. This potential energy is converted to kinetic energy during changes of direction and flow contractions. Then the water flowing out of the contractions makes jets that lose their energy in whirlpools and the whirlpools become smaller and smaller. Finally the viscosity of the water stops the small eddies but in the process the water deforms. In the process of deformation the particles in the water are carried at different speeds by the water and in this transport through the water the particles may collide.

    The cloudy water in the bottle carries colloidal particles, which do not settle out. The objective of the flocculator and sludge blanket is to increase the particle size so that they can be removed from the water by gravity.

    The formation of a floc through collisions between particles in water. A floc actually carries thousands of the primary particles.

In the AguaClara plant the flocculator is a series of channels with blades and tubes that direct the flow of water. As the stream of water turns around a "baffle" or passes between two tubes, it expands. This turbulent expansion is where conditions are created that promote collisions between particles causing relative velocities in the flow.

    Isometric view of an AguaClara flocculator with transparent walls. The blue arrows indicate the direction of water flow.

The baffles are made of polycarbonate sheets. They are connected by a PVC pipe structure of |ND.FlocMod|, with spacers of |ND.FlocSpacer|. The flexible material is used so that the baffles fit precisely into the channels without gaps between the sheets and the walls. The modules are easy to remove for cleaning or maintenance of the flocculator (:numref:`figure_floc_deflectors`).

    The flocculator baffle modules.

With the exception of the first one, each flocculator channel has an |ND.FlocDrain| diameter drain at the end attached to the plant cleaning channel. The drains are simply operated by removing a long PVC nipple that extends above the water (:numref:`figure_floc_elev_deflectors`).

    Image of a flocculator with the baffle modules raised and supported by the cross tubes. This is done so that the low baffles are not damaged by static water pressure when the channels are being filled. The nipples of the drains are seen in the foreground.
