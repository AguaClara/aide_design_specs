        Drainage Valves
===============


        The sedimentation chamber has two valves to purge the sludge and empty the tanks for cleaning and maintenance. The one most commonly used during normal operation is the diameter valve |ND.SedHopperDrain| that comes out of the floc hopper. This valve is used only to remove the accumulated sludge from the hopper. To empty the tank completely for cleaning and maintenance, the lower diameter valve |ND.SedJetReverser| is used.
