At the end of its journey in the flocculator, the flocculated water enters the distribution channel of the sedimentation tanks. From this channel the water is divided between the |N.SedTanks| sedimentation tanks. There is a chute that runs along the channel that serves to maintain the water level in the flocculator when the entrances to the sedimentation tanks are closed and flocculated water is being dumped. The operator would do this in the event of a coagulant dosing failure until good flocculation is recovered, for example.

            Manifold distributor and diffusers

A pipe of diameter |ND.SedManifold|, which is called the inlet manifold, carries the water from the distribution channel to the bottom of each tank. The water exits the manifold from below through a series of vertical pipes of diameter |ND.SedDiffuser| that runs along the length of the tank. The lower ends of these tubes are formed in such a way that the jets are joined and a single linear jet results. This serves to maintain the sludge blanket, re-suspending all particles that settle and slide down the slopes of the tank to the curve at the bottom.

After leaving the distribution pipe, the water slowly rises through the sludge blanket and plates to the top of the tank. It leaves the tank, already cleaned, through the holes in the collecting pipe. The collecting pipe takes the water to the outlet channel, which has another chute to maintain the water level in the tanks. After falling down the outlet chute, the water comes out through the tubes that take it to the sand filters.
