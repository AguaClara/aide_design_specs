        Purpose and Description
=======================


        The main objective of the sedimentation tanks is to remove the sediment from the water by the force of gravity. In this process the water rises slowly while the suspended particles fall and remain at the bottom of the tank. The operator purges the accumulated sludge through a valve in the plantâ€™s cleaning channel.

The tanks have sloping plates that allow the capture of finer particles. In addition, the tanks are designed in such a way that the settled sludge cannot remain on the bottom, but is re-suspended to maintain a **sludge blanket** at the bottom. The sludge blanket is a concentrated suspension of sediment that improves the performance of the tank and concentrates the surplus sludge.
